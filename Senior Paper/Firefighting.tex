\section{\label{Intro}Introduction}

\subsection{\label{ForestFires} Forest Fires and their Effects}

In early November of 2018, a forest fire started near Camp Creek Road in Butte County, California, grew until it was finally contained on November 25th. In this time the fire burned over 150,000 acres of land with mass evacuations for nearby towns.\cite{CampFire, CampFireReport} While this was the largest single wildfire in California's history, 2018 was only the 5th largest year of burned acres in the past decade with over 2.2 million acres burned in 2017.\cite{WildFireYear}

\subsection{\label{CellularAutomaton} Cellular Automaton}

Cellular Automaton is a method of simulation in which instead of simulating an entire system as a whole, the system is split up into a grid of many cells where each cell can only interact with its nearest cells. One of the most known uses and simplest examples of cellular automaton is Conway's Game of Life.

Conway's Game of Life has three rules from which many complex patterns can emerge.\cite{ConwayGoL} The glider (Fig. \ref{Glider}) is one of the simplest repeating patterns in the Game of Life moving diagonally across the board repeating the same set of states every 4 simulation steps.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A live cell survives if it has two or three live neighbors
	\item A new cell is born whenever there are three live neighbors
	\item All other cells either die or remain inactive
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\subsection{\label{Convolution} Convolution}

A 2D convolution is a function that takes in a 2D matrix and a kernel. The kernel is usually smaller matrix that is "slid" over the larger matrix. Convolutions are largely used in neural networks and computer vision applications. 2D convolutions are especially useful in cellular automaton applications due to matrix math being much more optimized then for loops.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Pictures/StaticConvolution}
	\caption{\label{2DConvolutionFig}2D convolution with zero padding and a 3x3 kernel}
\end{figure}

\section{\label{Method}Method}

The firefighting simulation is set as a set of 2D matrices. Each of the matrices represent a property of the simulation that include which tree's are on fire and the age of the tree's. On each simulation step, tree age's are incremented by the simulation step size. The amount of mass a tree has is proportional to the age of the tree. The mass increases until the tree is 100 years old, after which the tree mass rapidly decreases until it is 120 years old at which point the tree is dead.

The spreading of tree's from an alive space to a dead space uses a 2D convolution. The 2D convolution is between the the mass matrix to a 3x3 matrix of value 0.01. This equates to 1\% chance for each fully grown tree around a dead space for the dead space to grow a new tree. For tree's which are not at full mass, the chance they give is linearly proportional to the current vs adult mass. This results in young or old tree's still having a chance to spread but not at the same rate. The tree mass matrix is then check for any negative values and sets these indexes to 0, equating to having a tree fully die.

At the end of each time step, a random floating point value between 0-1 is generated. If the value generated is below 5E-5, a random tree is set on fire. This equates to approximately 13 years between fire events. This allows the forest enough time to recover and equates to the small chance some embers from a lightning strike or human caused fires growing large enough to start a fire on the forest scale.

When their is a fire event going on, a binary matrix with the binary value for each tree being on fire is multiplied element by element by the normalized tree mass in each cell. A 2D convolution is then done with a 5x5 kernal with a Gaussian distribution (Fig. \ref{GuassDist}).

\end{figure}

By comparing the graphs for starting fires (Fig. \ref{StartFire}) to the graphs for no protection and cutting down trees (Fig. \ref{CutTrees},\ref{NoProtect}), the starting fire has a smaller density of higher mass burned and fraction of edges burned then the other strategies.

\section{\label{FutureWork}Future Work}

Improvements include implementing climate simulation such as dry seasons or years decreasing the rate of tree growth and increasing their flammability. With this improvement, different regions can be simulated from the rainy Midwest to the hot and dry west.

Future work could also include implementing wind biasing on fire spreading such that a strong wind to the west would decrease the chance a fire would spread to the east but increase the chance to spread to the west.

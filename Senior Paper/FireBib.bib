@article{WindFire,
	Abstract = {Operational forest fire simulation models typically incorporate reduction factors to modify winds forecast to meteorological standards for open environments so that they characterise the sub-canopy winds that drive fire spread. While these reduction factors may vary between forest types, they are typically static; wind reduction is constant regardless of height within the sub-canopy space and forecast wind speed.The validity of using static wind reduction factors was investigated by measuring sub-canopy horizontal wind speeds at different heights in seven vegetation types across Victoria, Australia. We found that the vertical wind profiles were highly variable, with substantial variation in response to height above ground and the prevailing (open environment) wind speed. The combined effect of these influences meant that within each forest type, wind reductions can vary by factors of greater than four.As wind is proportional to fire spread in most simulation models, this high level of},

@article{CellAutmoFire,
	Abstract = {Traditional models result in low efficiency and poor accuracy when simulating the spread of large-scale forest fires. We constructed an improved model that couples cellular automata with an existing forest fire model to ensure better time accuracy of forest fire spread. Our model considers the impact of time steps on simulation accuracy to provide an optimal time step value. The model was tested using a case study of forest fire spread at Daxingâ€™an Mountain in May 2006. The results show that the optimal time step for the forest fire spread geographic cellular automata simulation algorithm is 1/8 of the time taken for cellular material to be completely combusted. When compared with real fire data from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, our model was found to have high temporal and spatial consistency, with a mean Kappa coefficient of 0.6352 and mean accuracy of 87.89%. This algorithm can be used to simulate and predict forest fire spread and is also reversible (i.e., it can identify },
